## 🚀 Getting Started
Follow these steps to run the bot locally. You can also host this bot on a free server like pella.



### 1. Install dependencies
Before you start, you'll need to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [create a Discord app](https://discord.com/developers/applications). Feel free to name the bot anything you want and upload a nice icon.

### 2a. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/JustWastingTime/TazunaDiscordBot.git
cd TazunaDiscordBot
npm install
```

### 2b. Fork the repository
If you'd like to still receive updates on the bot (as it is a Work in Progress), you can fork the repo instead of cloning it. I'm not gonna expand much on this as you should have some knowledge on this already if you are picking this option.

### 3. Create your credentials file
Rename .env.sample to just .env.  
Head to the discord app you just created and copy the application id (`APP_ID`) and public key (`PUBLIC_KEY`) into the .env file. Then head into the Bot page and generate a Bot Token and save it as (`DISCORD_TOKEN`) in the .env.

### 4. Install slash commands

The commands are set up in `commands.js` (more on the commands later). All of the commands in the `ALL_COMMANDS` array at the bottom of `commands.js` will be installed when you run the `register` command configured in `package.json`:

```
npm run register
```

### 5. Run the app

After your credentials are added, go ahead and run the app:

```
npm run start
```

### 6a. Set up interactivity

The project needs a public endpoint where Discord can send requests. To develop and test locally, you can use something like [`ngrok`](https://ngrok.com/) to tunnel HTTP traffic.

Install ngrok if you haven't already, then start listening on port `3000`:

```
ngrok http 3000
```

You should see your connection open:

```
Tunnel Status                 online
Version                       2.0/2.0
Web Interface                 http://127.0.0.1:4040
Forwarding                    https://1234-someurl.ngrok.io -> localhost:3000

Connections                  ttl     opn     rt1     rt5     p50     p90
                              0       0       0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00
```

Copy the forwarding address that starts with `https`, in this case `https://1234-someurl.ngrok.io`, then go to your [app's settings](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

On the **General Information** tab, there will be an **Interactions Endpoint URL**. Paste your ngrok address there, and append `/interactions` to it (`https://1234-someurl.ngrok.io/interactions` in the example).

Click **Save Changes**, and your app should be ready to run 🚀

### 6b. Using free hosting
Sign up on a free web app hosting service such as pella.app and select Web App. Select the Express JS type and upload the current folder as a zip. In this case, do not upload the .env file and instead copy down the .env keys into the settings panel of your web app. Save and press start.

Go to the Manage tab and copy the domain given here. On the **General Information** tab, there will be an **Interactions Endpoint URL**. Paste your address there, and append `/interactions` to it (`https://someweirdname.onpella.app/interactions`).

Click **Save Changes**, and your app should be ready to run 🚀
